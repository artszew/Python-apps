<b> Assignment 1 - an objective app about simulation involving a wolf that tries to catch sheep scattered in a meadow, which uses text mode. </b>
- each round consists of the movement of sheep (in one of 4 randomly selected directions of the world), and then the movement of the wolf, which chases the sheep closest to him,
- via the config.ini file you can choose the number of rounds, sheep, the distance of sheep and wolf movement, as well as the initial area in which sheep can appear (randomly), if you do not choose this option, the default settings will be used,
- at the end of each round, information about the wolf's position and the number of live sheep is written to the console, if the wolf ate a sheep during the round, this will also be written to the console,
- at the end of each round, information about the round number and the number of living sheep is saved to a csv file,
- at the end of each round, information about the round number, the exact position of the wolf and the sheep is saved to a json file,
- the program accepts several command-line arguments for flexibility. These include options to specify a custom configuration file (-c/--config), set the logging level (-l/--log), define the maximum number of rounds (-r/--rounds), specify the number of sheep (-s/--sheep), and optionally add a pause after each round (-w/--wait). If these arguments are not provided, the program uses default values.
- the program uses Python's built-in logging module to log key events during the simulation. The log level can be set to one of several levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), and logs are written to a chase.log file. Events are logged with different levels of detail based on the log level: from detailed debug information about each sheep and wolf movement to high-level info on simulation progress, sheep status, and round outcomes.
